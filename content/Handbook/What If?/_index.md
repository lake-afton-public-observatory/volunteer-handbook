If it should be necessary to handle these unusual situations...

- **Someone is being obnoxious and won't stop**. If they refuse to stop after having been nicely asked to, have the lead that is working with you talk to them. If they persist, the lead will call the sheriff's department (911). At no time should you try to force them to do something; let the sheriff's department handle it. (We have not had to go past asking the person to stop in the past.) Emergency numbers are by the cash register. There is another copy in the office.
  
- **There is a tornado in the area**. Have people sit along the inside walls of the large exhibit room. Start seating people along the wall nearest the light trap and work your way around to the large monitor (but not under it) and finally to the wall under the projector screen. The light trap should NOT be used.

- **There is a fire**. Sound the fire alarm (it is a local building alarm only) and lead people out in an orderly fashion through the front door and/or back door. Call 911. There is a fire extinguisher located in the exhibit area across from the cash register. A second fire extinguisher is located next to the black storage cabinet in the Observing Room (lift it to free it from the bracket). A third is by the back door. Fire alarms are located in three places: just to the right of the office door near the light switches; in the large exhibit room to the left of the light switches and large monitor; and in the Observing Room quite a bit to the left of the light switches near the door, which leads to the vestibule. These are local alarms only. They will not notify the fire department. Someone will need to call 911 to report the fire. The person in the Observing Room is responsible for making sure that everyone in the light trap, observing room, storage room, and darkroom get out safely through the back door (if possible). The person in the exhibit area is responsible for making sure that everyone in the light trap, both exhibit rooms, both bathrooms, and the office get out safely through the front door (if possible).

- **There is a thunderstorm nearby**. Turn off and unplug all electronic equipment from the outlets if you can safely do so. The telescope and slide computers should be shut down immediately if they are on, as should all other computers. An electrical storm is considered to be nearby if you can hear the thunder as well as see the lightning. If in doubt, turn electronic equipment off and unplug it.

- **Someone comes in with a weapon and demands the money in the register**. Don’t try to be a hero. Be cooperative and give them the money. Since the office is locked, that is all the money you will have access to. After they leave, call 911 immediately. Ask another staff member to help you recount what happened, including details of what the individual was wearing, etc. Have the lead lock the front door and notify people on the pad of what has happened.

- **Someone is carrying a weapon, but isn’t disturbing anyone**. Open carry is not permitted. You may politely ask the individual to secure their weapon in their vehicle or to leave if anyone is uncomfortable.
