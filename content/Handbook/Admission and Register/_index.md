## Annual Passes

We offer guests the opportunity to purchase Annual Passes that allow them free admission for a year, and a monthly newsletter email. Annual Admission Passes are available for individuals, youths, seniors and families.  

If they purchase the annual pass during their visit, they can apply their admission as discount to the purchase of the annual pass (scenario covered later).  

Have the guest complete an Annual Pass Card to collect their details, ring up the purchase transaction and then provide the Annual Pass card to the evening lead.  

The lead will enter the guests information into our membership database and produce the laminated membership card to be handed to the guest during their visit – usually only takes about 10 minutes to complete.

## Cash Register Start-up Procedure

1. Your lead for the night will get the starting cash, the key, and the iPad out of the safe.

2. Count the starting cash. Note this amount to enter in the Square app when starting the drawer and write it on the Cash Register Log for later.  Please write any unusual or helpful details regarding the evening on the back of the Cash Register Log – this will be helpful information when doing the bookkeeping

## Cash Register Transaction

1. Tap a category to start a transaction. Each admission and merchandise category should have its own icon. 

   There is a Family Rate Discount for use in discounting a family admission back to $20. Use the Discounts button to access a menu of discount options: Annual Pass discount, Cloudy Night discount, etc, … 
   Use the Donation button to enter any donated monies.
   
   > **NOTE**: Seniors, Military members, and Sedgwick County Employees receive discounts on admission.  
   > For these individuals, use the Discount icon featuring the man with a white beard.

2. We keep track of the quantities of various age groups that visit us to aid in applying for grants. Always indicate the age groups that are represented and the quantities of each. Then, if necessary, tap the Family Rate or Discounts icon in the second row to subtract the needed amount to make the final total the correct (e.g. $20 for a family, or $3/person for scheduled private events). If the customer is an Annual Pass holder, select the proper Pass Type, by tapping the Discount button next to the Family Rate button. This will subtract the amount for you.

3. After an admission category has been selected, there are options to change the quantity, apply the 50% Cloudy Night Coupon and/or the Employee Discount (10% for merchandise).

4. After all items are entered, tap Charge.

5. Tap the amount given to you if given cash, or swipe the customer’s credit card. You can also choose Manual Entry of Credit Card if desired.
   
6. Swipe credit/debit card with Square.

7. Have customer sign with finger or stylus. Ask them to select an option for the receipt.

## Private Events

If you should be working cash register during a Private Event:  

We have special pricing for Private Events, and ideally, the organizer of the event will pay in advance, or at arrival for the entire party.  

However, if that is not the case, there is a worksheet that will identify the costs breakdown for calculating the admissions rate for the private party and the lead should help with determining what the event charge will be.  

There may be merchandise purchases made by the event attendees that would be handled as usual.  This may also include Annual Pass purchases and Donations.

4. Enter the Lead’s name and your name for the Drawer Description, if not already done during Drawer Start

5. Take the receipt that prints and the cash into the office to count the money. Fill out the Cash Register Log as indicated.

6. Your Lead will verify and sign the Cash Register Log and place everything back in the safe.

## Transaction Scenarios

Almost every situation that might be needed during a transaction, should be available under the Admissions & Merch screen. Here you can select guest admission types, any necessary discounts, merchandise purchases, annual pass purchases, and even donations.

Accurately selecting the correct items is important for our tracking guest admission numbers which may help us with grant applications and tracking inventory of merchandise and what sells best.
