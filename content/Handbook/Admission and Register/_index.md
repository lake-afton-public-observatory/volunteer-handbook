## Cash Register Transaction

1. Tap a category to start a transaction. Each admission and merchandise category should have its own icon. 

   There is a Family Rate Discount for use in discounting a family admission back to $20. Use the Discounts button to access a menu of discount options: Annual Pass discount, Cloudy Night discount, etc, … 
   Use the Donation button to enter any donated monies.
   
   > **NOTE**  
   > Seniors, Military members, and Sedgwick County Employees receive discounts on admission.  
   > For these individuals, use the Discount icon featuring the man with a white beard.  
 
2. We keep track of the quantities of various age groups that visit us to aid in applying for grants. Always indicate the age groups that are represented and the quantities of each. Then, if necessary, tap the Family Rate or Discounts icon in the second row to subtract the needed amount to make the final total the correct (e.g. $20 for a family, or $3/person for scheduled private events). If the customer is an Annual Pass holder, select the proper Pass Type, by tapping the Discount button next to the Family Rate button. This will subtract the amount for you.

3. After an admission category has been selected, there are options to change the quantity, apply the 50% Cloudy Night Coupon and/or the Employee Discount (10% for merchandise).

4. After all items are entered, tap Charge.

5. Tap the amount given to you if given cash, or swipe the customer’s credit card. You can also choose Manual Entry of Credit Card if desired.
   
6. Swipe credit/debit card with Square.

7. Have customer sign with finger or stylus. Ask them to select an option for the receipt.
