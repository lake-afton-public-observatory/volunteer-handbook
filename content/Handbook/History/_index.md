The observatory was created in 1979 as a joint effort between four areas of government: Sedgwick County, the City of Wichita, the Wichita Board of Education and Wichita State University. It opened on June 12, 1981, and was operated by Wichita State Universityâ€™s Fairmount Center for Science and Mathematics Education until they decided to cease their involvement in 2015. 

Just one year later, the observatory was reopened by local volunteers, mostly from the Kansas Astronomical Observers (KAO) and Open Wichita. It is now an independent 501(c)(3) public charity that is completely run by volunteers, such as yourself, with no paid staff. Sedgwick County continues to maintain ownership of the building and provide funding for facilities and maintenance. The observatory remains unique as it is one of a handful of observatories built specifically for public outreach.
