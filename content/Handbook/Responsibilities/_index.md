## Scheduling

1.	Notify the scheduler of your unavailability by the required date. If no information is given to the scheduler by the deadline, you will not be scheduled. You may contact the Volunteer Coordinator and/or the scheduler to be added to the schedule.

2.	Once the schedule has been sent out, if a conflict arises on a night you are scheduled, YOU are responsible for finding a replacement to fill your position for the evening. Contact your lead for assistance and/or to let him/her know that a replacement has been found.

3.	Volunteers are expected to arrive 30 minutes prior to opening. You should plan on staying about 30 minutes after closing to help clean up and shut things down.
iv.	If you are going to be late, let your lead know ASAP.

## Nightly Responsibilities

1.	As a whole, we must work as a team to help the guests feel welcome, enjoy their time while they are there, to learn something, and encourage them to come back. Be attentive whenever a guest is nearby. We are here for them and because of them. Engage them in conversation but allow them to enjoy the exhibits and displays on their own. 

2.	Encourage visitors to find us on Facebook, follow us on X (formerly known as Twitter), to tell their friends about us and, most importantly, to come back. Remind them that the sky changes every season, and that the visibility of deep space objects depends on the phase of the moon.

### Inside Telescope

The volunteer(s) scheduled for the “Inside Telescope” position are responsible for setup and shutdown of the indoor telescope as well as giving guests short, informative presentations about each object on the viewing list for that night. Describe to people what they will see, then give them specific information about that object or classification of object (double star, emission nebula, etc.). An online database is available for access by volunteers from home or their mobile device: LAPO Explainer Notes. These notes are also available on the computer in the observing room. 

Direct people to the exhibits for more information about each object. Gage the level of interest of the group. Some people will hang on every word you say, others will lose interest quickly. Adjust the amount of information you share accordingly. You do not need to be an expert but do your best to give basic information and answer questions. It is ok to tell someone, “I don’t know the answer to that, but I’d be happy to look it up and post it on our Facebook page.” 

See Telescope Section for Start Up and Shutdown procedures.

### Outside

The volunteer scheduled for the “Outside” position is encouraged to set up their own telescope outside on the pad. It is important to engage the public in conversation and answer their questions. Be as welcoming and as helpful as you can. Encourage people to tryout the observatory’s small telescopes and binoculars, utilizing the fake sky to practice aligning and focusing. Guests can also refer to the Star Games display for ideas of objects to look for. 

If the forecast is not favorable for staying outside, you may help out inside and do 2-3 constellation tours during the evening instead of setting up your telescope. (Feel free to do a constellation tour any night, regardless of the weather). 

See Outside Exhibit and Constellation Tour Section for how to layout the exhibits.

### Cashier

The volunteer scheduled for the “Cashier” position is responsible for getting the register ready at the beginning of the night, taking admission, and counting the register at the end of the night. As admission is collected, stamp people’s hands as needed and offer the kids glow sticks (if available). Give the people a brief overview of the objects we will be viewing and explain where the exhibits are, including the outside exhibits. Complete the form for tracking the money at the end of the evening. Never leave the cash register without removing the key! 

See Admission and Cash Register Section for Setup and Shutdown procedures.

### Exhibits

The volunteer scheduled for the “Exhibit” position is responsible for turning on and testing all exhibits to make sure they are in working order before the program begins. Report any problems with an exhibit to the Lead. If the VR goggles are available, set them up as necessary. Make sure proper care is used by guests while using the VR goggles (sitting in one of the swivel chairs), and make sure no one walks off with them. Be familiar with the exhibits and the current information being displayed. Offer assistance but be willing to let people explore on their own. You do not need to be an expert but do your best to give basic information and answer questions. It is ok to tell someone, “I don’t know the answer to that, but I’d be happy to look it up and post it on our Facebook page.” 

See Indoor Exhibit Section for Setup and Shutdown Procedures.

> NOTE: It is not imperative that you stay in the same position all night. You are welcome to switch or rotate with another volunteer during the evening.
