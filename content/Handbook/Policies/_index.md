## Inclement Weather:

- The observatory will close during active severe weather warnings that impact the observatory area. If weather permits, we will reopen. Contact your lead for the evening in you are in doubt.

- Cloudy nights: We do not close on rainy or cloudy nights. However, if someone pays admission and the skies cloud over, to the point where they canâ€™t see any objects, they can be issued a coupon for half off their next visit.

## Volunteer Conduct

How our volunteers conduct themselves is a large part of how our guests will think of LAPO as an organization. Help us welcome every guest (or potential guest) that walks through our doors. Be attentive, respectful, and polite. This is important in person or through social media.
