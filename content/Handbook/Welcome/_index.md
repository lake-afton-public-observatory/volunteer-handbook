We are excited to have you as a part of the Lake Afton Public Observatory staff!  
We couldn’t keep our doors open without the dedication of our volunteers. 

## Mission

Our mission is to promote appreciation and education of astronomy by making it more accessible to the public. 

We want to share the wonders of the universe with the general public, young and old, and educate them about the science of astronomy. 

Seeing celestial objects through the 16” telescope is a treat enough in itself, but interactive exhibits and informative presentations help people learn the science behind the formation, behavior, and ultimate fate of each of these objects. You don’t have to have all of the answers.  

We just want to educate and share our enthusiasm with public, and you are a necessary part of that goal. Our purpose is to provide people an opportunity to learn more about the universe and what takes place in it.
