The content for this Volunteer Handbook are managed under the GitHub - LAPO Volunteer Handbook website [repo](https://github.com/lake-afton-public-observatory/volunteer-handbook).

If you have any suggestions for content, product questions, or are not finding the detail necessary for supporting this LAPO Volunteer Handbook, please email your comments to [LAPO Tech Support](mailto://cketron@lakeafton.com>)

In an effort to make the Lake Afton Public Observatory Volunteer Handbook more accessible, the handbook has been translated into Markdown (*.md) files and using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework for building a static website. The MarkDown content files are converted into HTML web-based documentation. The LAPO Volunteer Handbook uses the [Hugo - TechDocs](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-techdoc/) theme.

The theme used for these can be found in the repo at ..\static\css\theme.css

Content suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated!! (Please create an [Issue](https://github.com/lake-afton-public-observatory/volunteer-handbook/issues) on the GitHub project.)
